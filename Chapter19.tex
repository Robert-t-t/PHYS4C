\section*{What is the frist law of Thermodynamics?}

To sum it up the frist law of Thermodynamic is energy transfering into/out of the system as work/heat



\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_{\text{th}} = W + Q
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta E_{\text{th}}$ = Change in thermal energy (J)
    \item $W$ = Work done on the system (J)
    \item $Q$ = Heat added to the system (J)
\end{itemize}


\section*{19.2 Work in Ideal-Gas Processes}

\begin{equation}
    W = - \int_{V_i}^{V_f} P \, dV
\end{equation}

\section*{Isochoric Process}

\begin{equation}
    W = 0
\end{equation}
Isochoric process is a process in which the volume of the system is constant and the work done is zero.


\section*{Isobaric Process}

    \begin{equation}
        W = - P \Delta V
    \end{equation}
    Isobaric process is a process in which the pressure of the system is constant and the work done is $-P \Delta V$.
